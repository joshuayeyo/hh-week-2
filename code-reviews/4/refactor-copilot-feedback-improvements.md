## üìù Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: Issue #4 - Multi-persona orchestration system
- **Dependencies**: Copilot feedback analysis completion
- **Breaking Changes**: None - purely enhancement changes

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**: Systematic boundary definition, clear role separation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Template for persona documentation standards

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict
