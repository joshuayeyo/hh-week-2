  - DatePicker: 21 lines (‚úÖ)
  - errorMessages: 24 lines (‚úÖ)
- [x] ‚úÖ Proper file naming conventions - Clear, descriptive names
- [x] ‚úÖ Correct directory structure - Components in `/components`, utilities in `/utils`
- [x] ‚úÖ Props in separate type files maintained

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ‚úÖ Correct import order maintained across all files
- [x] ‚úÖ Named exports used consistently
- [x] ‚úÖ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized properly

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ‚úÖ Functions: verb + noun pattern (`createDatePickerDialog`, `handleDatePickerClick`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality (`DateInput`, `CountInput`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`ERROR_MESSAGES`, `HELPER_MESSAGES`)

### 4. Performance Optimizations

#### ‚úÖ Mathematical Optimization

- [x] **Daily Calculations**: O(n) loop ‚Üí O(1) mathematical formula
- [x] **Weekly Calculations**: O(n) loop ‚Üí O(1) mathematical formula
- [x] **Performance Guards**: Maximum iteration limits for monthly/yearly calculations
- [x] **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced object creation in loops

#### ‚úÖ React Performance

- [x] **Debouncing**: 300ms debounce on date input changes
- [x] **Memoization**: Proper use of useMemo for expensive calculations
- [x] **Component Memoization**: memo() used appropriately on pure components
- [x] **Callback Optimization**: useCallback prevents unnecessary re-renders

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

#### ‚úÖ Visual Feedback

- [x] **Performance Warnings**: Visual alerts for large date ranges or high counts
- [x] **Constraint Guidance**: Clear messaging about date limits and restrictions
- [x] **Error Styling**: Consistent error visual treatment across components
- [x] **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, role attributes, and live regions

#### ‚úÖ Interaction Improvements

- [x] **Debounced Input**: Reduces API calls and improves responsiveness
- [x] **Contextual Help**: Dynamic helper text based on current selections
- [x] **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful handling of boundary conditions
