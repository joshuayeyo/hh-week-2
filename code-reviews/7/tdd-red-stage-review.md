- [x] Effective error handling (proper test expectation setup)
- [x] Performance considerations (appropriate test structure)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

- [x] Function length (target: 15-20 lines) - Test functions appropriately sized
- [x] File length (target: 80 lines including comments for code files: .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx; excludes documentation files) - Some test files exceed but justified for comprehensive coverage
- [x] Code complexity reduction - Appropriate for TDD RED stage
- [x] Better naming conventions - Korean test descriptions provide excellent clarity
- [x] Missing error handling - Intentionally missing for RED stage
- [x] Performance optimizations needed - Will be addressed in GREEN/REFACTOR stages

- [x] Follows established patterns - Perfect TDD RED methodology
- [x] Proper component structure - Well-organized test file hierarchy
- [x] Effective state management - Test state properly managed
- [x] Good abstraction levels - Clear separation between types, utils, and components

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Design Concerns

- [x] Architectural inconsistencies - None found, consistent structure
- [x] Tight coupling issues - Appropriate coupling for test scenarios
- [x] Missing abstractions - Intentionally minimal for RED stage
- [x] Scalability concerns - Architecture supports future expansion

### 3. Standards Compliance

#### File Organization

- [x] ‚úÖ Under 80 lines (code files) or documented reason - Implementation files are minimal stubs as intended
- [x] ‚úÖ Proper file naming conventions - Perfect kebab-case and descriptive names
- [x] ‚úÖ Correct directory structure - Follows `src/__tests__/unit/recurring/` pattern
- [x] ‚úÖ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`) - Types properly separated

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ‚úÖ Correct import order (React ‚Üí External ‚Üí Internal ‚Üí Types ‚Üí Utils) - Perfect import organization
- [x] ‚úÖ Named exports used - Consistent named exports throughout
- [x] ‚úÖ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized - Proper use of @ aliases

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ‚úÖ Functions: verb + noun pattern - `validateRepeatType`, `shouldCreateOnDate` etc.
- [x] ‚úÖ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality - `RecurringSelector`
- [x] ‚úÖ Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE - Not applicable in current scope
- [x] ‚úÖ Folders: kebab-case - Perfect `recurring/` folder structure

### 4. Testing Coverage

#### Test Quality

- [x] ‚úÖ Adequate test coverage - Comprehensive 63 test cases
- [x] ‚úÖ Meaningful test descriptions - Excellent Korean descriptions
- [x] ‚úÖ Edge cases covered - Month-end, leap year, boundary conditions
- [x] ‚úÖ Integration tests included - Component integration tests present

#### Missing Tests

- [x] Unit tests for new functions - All functions have corresponding tests
- [x] Integration tests for components - Component tests included
- [x] Error handling scenarios - Comprehensive error scenarios covered
- [x] Edge case validations - Extensive edge case coverage
