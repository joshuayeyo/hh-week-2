- [x] ✅ Proper file naming conventions
- [x] ✅ Correct directory structure
- [x] ✅ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`)

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ✅ Correct import order (React → External → Internal → Types → Utils)

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `2/10`
- **Function Count**: `1` function (getFilteredEvents) with comprehensive testing
- **Average Function Length**: `10` lines per test case
- **Type Safety Score**: `100%`

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `maintained`
- **Test Count**: `8` comprehensive test cases
- **Test Types**: Unit tests with integration scenarios

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### For Developer

- [x] **Action 1**: Successfully updated import paths to use path aliases
- [x] **Action 2**: Updated type imports to use new EventProps type
- [x] **Action 3**: Maintained comprehensive test coverage

### For Future Reviews

- [x] Monitor performance after changes
- [x] Verify test coverage improvements
- [x] Check for regression issues

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: Issue #3 - Migrate previous codebase
- **Dependencies**: No new dependencies introduced
- **Breaking Changes**: None - only import path and type updates

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**: Demonstrated appropriate use of single describe block for single function
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team can learn when to maintain existing test structure vs. modularizing

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ✅ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge
- [ ] 🔄 **REQUEST CHANGES** - Needs modifications before merge
- [ ] ❌ **REJECT** - Significant issues require major rework

**Reasoning**: Appropriate updates to imports and types while maintaining good test structure

**Next Steps**: Proceed with commit and complete test migration work
