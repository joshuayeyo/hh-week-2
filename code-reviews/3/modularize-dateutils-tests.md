#### ✅ Strengths

- [x] Clear and descriptive function/variable names
- [x] Proper TypeScript usage with strict types
- [x] Good separation of concerns
- [x] Effective error handling
- [x] Performance considerations

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

- [x] Function length (target: 15-20 lines)
- [x] File length (target: 80 lines including comments for code files: .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx; excludes documentation files)
- [ ] Code complexity reduction
- [ ] Better naming conventions
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations needed

### 2. Architecture & Design

#### ✅ Good Practices

- [x] Follows established patterns
- [x] Proper component structure
- [x] Effective state management

- [x] ✅ Proper file naming conventions
- [x] ✅ Correct directory structure
- [x] ✅ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`)

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ✅ Correct import order (React → External → Internal → Types → Utils)
- [x] ✅ Named exports used
- [x] ✅ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ✅ Functions: verb + noun pattern
- [x] ✅ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality
- [x] ✅ Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- [x] ✅ Folders: kebab-case

### 4. Testing Coverage

#### Test Quality

- [x] ✅ Adequate test coverage
- [x] ✅ Meaningful test descriptions
- [x] ✅ Edge cases covered
- [x] ✅ Integration tests included

#### Missing Tests

- [ ] Unit tests for new functions
