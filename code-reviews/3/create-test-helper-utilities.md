- [x] Clear and descriptive function/variable names
- [x] Proper TypeScript usage with strict types
- [x] Good separation of concerns
- [x] Effective error handling
- [ ] Performance considerations

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

- [ ] Function length (target: 15-20 lines)
- [x] File length (target: 80 lines including comments for code files: .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx; excludes documentation files)
- [ ] Code complexity reduction
- [ ] Better naming conventions
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations needed

### 2. Architecture & Design

- [x] ✅ Proper file naming conventions
- [x] ✅ Correct directory structure
- [x] ✅ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`)

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ✅ Correct import order (React → External → Internal → Types → Utils)
- [x] ✅ Named exports used
- [x] ✅ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ✅ Functions: verb + noun pattern
- [x] ✅ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality
- [x] ✅ Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- [x] ✅ Folders: kebab-case

### 4. Testing Coverage

---

## 📊 Metrics

### Code Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `2/10`
- **Function Count**: `4`
- **Average Function Length**: `14` lines
- **Type Safety Score**: `100%`

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `N/A%` (Helper utilities)
- **Test Count**: `N/A` tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (`N/A`), Integration (`N/A`)

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### For Developer

- [x] **Replace any types**: All `any` types replaced with proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] **Fix import order**: All imports follow ESLint standards
- [x] **Add ESLint config**: Helpers directory added to test file patterns

### For Future Reviews

- [ ] Monitor performance after changes
- [x] Verify test coverage improvements
- [ ] Check for regression issues

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: Issue #3 - Migrate previous codebase
- **Dependencies**: Depends on existing MSW handlers and Vitest setup
- **Breaking Changes**: None

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**: Proper TypeScript typing, import organization, error handling
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Template for creating reusable test utilities

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ✅ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge
- [ ] 🔄 **REQUEST CHANGES** - Needs modifications before merge
- [ ] ❌ **REJECT** - Significant issues require major rework

**Reasoning**: High-quality implementation with proper TypeScript typing, following coding standards, and providing reusable utilities that will improve test maintainability.

**Next Steps**: Proceed with commit and continue with remaining test file migrations.
