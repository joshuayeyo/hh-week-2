- **Architecture Evolution**: Perfect foundation for further utility expansion

---

## 📊 Metrics

### Code Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `1-2/10`
- **Function Count**: `10`
- **Average Function Length**: `8` lines
- **Type Safety Score**: `100%`

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `0%`
- **Test Count**: `0` tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (`0`), Integration (`0`)

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### For Developer

- [ ] **Action 1**: Add unit tests for all date utility functions
- [ ] **Action 2**: Add integration tests for calendar components using these utilities
- [ ] **Action 3**: Consider adding JSDoc comments for complex date calculations

### For Future Reviews

- [x] Monitor performance after changes
- [ ] Verify test coverage improvements
- [ ] Check for regression issues

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: #3 - 이전 과제 코드베이스 마이그레이션
- **Dependencies**: None - pure utility functions
- **Breaking Changes**: None - additive changes only

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**: Perfect modular utility organization, single responsibility principle
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Excellent example of how to break down monolithic utility files into focused modules

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ✅ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge
- [ ] 🔄 **REQUEST CHANGES** - Needs modifications before merge
- [ ] ❌ **REJECT** - Significant issues require major rework

**Reasoning**: 완벽한 모듈화와 코딩 스탠다드 준수. 모든 함수가 단일 책임을 가지며, 타입 안전성과 성능이 우수함.

**Next Steps**: 커밋 후 다음 유틸리티 모듈 마이그레이션 진행
