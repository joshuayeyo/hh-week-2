- [x] Bundle size considerations

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **High Priority**:

   - [x] Fix critical security issues
   - [x] Resolve breaking changes
   - [x] Address performance bottlenecks

2. **Medium Priority**:

   - [ ] Improve code documentation
   - [x] Add missing tests
   - [x] Refactor complex functions

3. **Low Priority**:
   - [x] Optimize imports
   - [x] Improve naming consistency
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments

### Future Improvements

- **Technical Debt**: None introduced - optimal hook structure
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: useSearch hook is perfectly optimized
- **Architecture Evolution**: Excellent foundation for advanced search features

---

## 📊 Metrics

### Code Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `1/10`
- **Function Count**: `1`
- **Average Function Length**: `23` lines
- **Type Safety Score**: `100%`

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `0%`
- **Test Count**: `0` tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (`0`), Integration (`0`)

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### For Developer

- [ ] **Action 1**: Add unit tests for search functionality
- [ ] **Action 2**: Add integration tests for filtered events
- [ ] **Action 3**: Consider adding debounce for search performance

### For Future Reviews

- [x] Monitor performance after changes
- [ ] Verify test coverage improvements
- [ ] Check for regression issues

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: #3 - 이전 과제 코드베이스 마이그레이션
- **Dependencies**: Uses getFilteredEvents utility and EventProps types
- **Breaking Changes**: None - improved structure maintains compatibility

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**: Perfect useMemo implementation for performance optimization
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Excellent example of custom hook with memoization patterns

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ✅ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge
- [ ] 🔄 **REQUEST CHANGES** - Needs modifications before merge
- [ ] ❌ **REJECT** - Significant issues require major rework

**Reasoning**: 완벽한 성능 최적화가 적용된 검색 훅. useMemo를 통한 메모이제이션으로 불필요한 재계산 방지.

**Next Steps**: 커밋 후 다음 훅 마이그레이션 진행
