- [x] ‚úÖ Proper file naming conventions (`OverlapDialog.types.ts`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Correct directory structure (`src/types/`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`)

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ‚úÖ Correct import order (single import from related Event types)
- [x] ‚úÖ Named exports used (both interfaces exported)
- [x] ‚úÖ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ‚úÖ Functions: N/A (type definitions only)
- [x] ‚úÖ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality (`OverlapDialogProps`, `OverlapDialogHandlerProps`)
- [x] ‚úÖ Constants: N/A
- [x] ‚úÖ Folders: kebab-case (N/A)

### 4. Testing Coverage

#### Test Quality

- [x] ‚úÖ Meaningful test descriptions (N/A)
- [x] ‚úÖ Edge cases covered (N/A)
- [x] ‚úÖ Integration tests included (N/A)

#### Missing Tests

- [x] Unit tests for new functions (N/A for type definitions)
- [x] Integration tests for components (component tests needed)
- [x] Error handling scenarios (N/A)
- [x] Edge case validations (N/A)

## üö® Critical Issues

### Security Concerns

- [x] No sensitive data exposure
- [x] Input validation present (handled at component level)
- [x] XSS prevention measures (handled at component level)
- [x] CSRF protection (handled at component level)

### Performance Issues

- [x] Efficient algorithms used (N/A)
- [x] Memory leak prevention (N/A)
- [x] Bundle size considerations (minimal type definitions)

---

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **High Priority**: None identified

2. **Medium Priority**: None identified

3. **Low Priority**:
   - [x] Optimize imports (already optimized)

   - [x] Add JSDoc comments (could be beneficial but not required)

### Future Improvements

- **Technical Debt**: None introduced
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Consider adding JSDoc comments for better developer experience
- **Architecture Evolution**: Well-aligned with current data/handler separation pattern

---

## üìä Metrics

### Code Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `1/10` (minimal complexity)
- **Function Count**: `0` (type definitions only)
- **Average Function Length**: `N/A` lines
- **Type Safety Score**: `100%`

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `N/A%` (type definitions)
- **Test Count**: `0` tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (`0`), Integration (`0`)

---

## üéØ Action Items

### For Developer

- [x] **Perfect Implementation**: No changes required - excellent adherence to data/handler separation pattern

### For Future Reviews

- [x] Monitor integration with OverlapDialog component implementation
- [x] Verify type usage in actual component files
- [x] Check for any additional handler requirements as features evolve

---

## üìù Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: Part of #3 - Ïù¥Ï†Ñ Í≥ºÏ†ú ÏΩîÎìúÎ≤†Ïù¥Ïä§ ÎßàÏù¥Í∑∏Î†àÏù¥ÏÖò
- **Dependencies**: Properly depends on Event.types.ts
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is new type definition

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**:
  - Perfect implementation of data/handler separation pattern
  - Clean, minimal interface definitions
  - Proper TypeScript usage with imported types
  - Excellent naming conventions matching project standards
- **Knowledge Sharing**: This serves as an excellent example of how to implement the data/handler separation pattern for dialog components

### Detailed Analysis

#### Data/Handler Separation Pattern Implementation

The file excellently implements the data/handler separation pattern:

- `OverlapDialogProps`: Contains pure data (isOpen boolean, overlappingEvents array)
- `OverlapDialogHandlerProps`: Contains handler functions (onClose, onContinue)

This separation allows for:

- Better testability
- Cleaner component props
- Improved code organization
- Easier maintenance

#### TypeScript Interface Design

- Clean, focused interfaces
- Proper type imports from related Event types
- Consistent naming with project conventions
- Minimal but complete type definitions

#### Integration with Event Types

- Properly imports and uses `EventProps` from Event types
- Maintains type safety throughout the component hierarchy
- Clean dependency chain: EventFormProps ‚Üí EventProps ‚Üí OverlapDialogProps

#### Code Standards Adherence

- File is well under the 80-line limit (14 lines)
- Follows established naming conventions
- Proper directory structure placement
- Clean import/export patterns

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ‚úÖ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge

**Reasoning**: This is an exemplary implementation of TypeScript type definitions following the data/handler separation pattern. The code is clean, well-structured, and perfectly adheres to all project standards. The interfaces are minimal yet complete, properly typed, and follow consistent naming conventions.

**Next Steps**:

1. Implement the actual OverlapDialog component using these types
2. Ensure proper integration testing when the component is created
3. Consider this as a reference implementation for future dialog type definitions
