### 3. Standards Compliance

#### File Organization

- [x] ‚úÖ Under 80 lines (code files) or documented reason
- [x] ‚úÖ Proper file naming conventions
- [x] ‚úÖ Correct directory structure
- [x] ‚úÖ Props in separate type files (`src/types/`) - N/A for constants

#### Import/Export Standards

- [x] ‚úÖ Correct import order (React ‚Üí External ‚Üí Internal ‚Üí Types ‚Üí Utils) - N/A for constants
- [x] ‚úÖ Named exports used
- [x] ‚úÖ Path aliases (`@/*`) utilized - N/A for basic constants

#### Naming Conventions

- [x] ‚úÖ Functions: verb + noun pattern - N/A for constants
- [x] ‚úÖ Components: PascalCase with clear functionality - N/A for constants
- [x] ‚úÖ Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- [x] ‚úÖ Folders: kebab-case

### 4. Testing Coverage

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **High Priority**:

   - [x] Fix critical security issues - None found
   - [x] Resolve breaking changes - None found
   - [x] Address performance bottlenecks - None found

2. **Medium Priority**:

   - [ ] Improve code documentation - Consider adding JSDoc comments
   - [x] Add missing tests - Not required for constants
   - [x] Refactor complex functions - N/A for constants

3. **Low Priority**:
   - [x] Optimize imports - Already optimized
   - [x] Improve naming consistency - Already consistent
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments - Would be beneficial

### Future Improvements

- **Technical Debt**: No technical debt introduced
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Consider adding TypeScript interfaces for notification options
- **Architecture Evolution**: Well-structured for future expansion

---

## üìä Metrics

### Code Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: `1/10` (Very Low)
- **Function Count**: `0` (Constants only)
- **Average Function Length**: `N/A` lines
- **Type Safety Score**: `85%` (Some could benefit from stronger typing)

### Test Metrics

- **Coverage Percentage**: `N/A%` (Constants don't require testing)
- **Test Count**: `0` tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (`0`), Integration (`0`)

---

## üéØ Action Items

### For Developer

- [ ] **Action 1**: Consider adding TypeScript interface for NOTIFICATION_OPTIONS structure
- [ ] **Action 2**: Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
- [ ] **Action 3**: Consider making HOLIDAY_RECORD more extensible for future years

### For Future Reviews

- [x] Monitor performance after changes - No performance impact
- [x] Verify test coverage improvements - N/A for constants
- [x] Check for regression issues - Minimal risk with constants

---

## üìù Additional Notes

### Context

- **Related Issues**: Part of codebase migration from previous assignment
- **Dependencies**: None - standalone constants
- **Breaking Changes**: None

### Learning Opportunities

- **Best Practices Applied**:
  - Proper UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming for constants
  - Good separation of concerns with individual files
  - Clean barrel export pattern in index.ts
  - TypeScript type definitions for holidays
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Demonstrates clean constants organization

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ‚úÖ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge
- [ ] üîÑ **REQUEST CHANGES** - Needs modifications before merge
- [ ] ‚ùå **REJECT** - Significant issues require major rework

**Reasoning**: All constants files follow proper naming conventions, maintain clean structure, and provide appropriate TypeScript typing. The code is well-organized and follows the established project standards.

**Next Steps**: Merge approved. Consider the minor enhancement suggestions for future iterations.
