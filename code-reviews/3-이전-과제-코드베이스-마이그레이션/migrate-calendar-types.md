---

## üéØ Action Items

### For Developer

- [x] **File Structure**: All files properly organized in `/src/types/calendars/`
- [x] **Type Composition**: Excellent use of interface extension in `CalendarProps`
- [x] **Import Organization**: Clean imports with proper path aliases

### For Future Reviews

- [ ] Monitor performance after changes
- [ ] Verify test coverage improvements (when components are implemented)
- [ ] Check for regression issues

---

## üìù Additional Notes

### Context

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict

**Decision**:

- [x] ‚úÖ **APPROVE** - Ready for merge

**Reasoning**:

The calendar types migration demonstrates excellent TypeScript practices with:

- Perfect adherence to the 80-line file limit
- Excellent interface composition and extension patterns
- Proper separation of concerns across type files
- Clean import organization with path aliases
- Comprehensive documentation where needed
- No security or performance concerns
- Consistent naming conventions throughout

**Next Steps**:
