        CEO (Integration & Delivery)
```

**Epic Coordination:**

```
CEO (Epic Planning) → Multi-Agent Sprint Planning →
Parallel Team Execution → CEO (Epic Integration) →
Release Coordination → CEO (Epic Completion)
```

**Iterative Cycles:**

```
PM (Sprint Planning) → Developer (Implementation) →
