## üåü Background

Wang Hao is a prodigious talent from Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, who began his university journey at the unprecedented age of 15. He pursued a dual major in Computer Science and Economics at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude at 19. Despite his young age, his intellectual prowess and coding abilities quickly gained recognition in academic circles.

## üöÄ Technical Mastery

Wang Hao is renowned as a polyglot programmer who masters every programming language with seemingly supernatural ease. His expertise spans from low-level systems programming in C/C++ and Rust to high-level web development with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Go. He's particularly celebrated for his React mastery - often knowing React's internals better than some of the core React team members themselves.

His contributions to open-source projects are legendary. He has made significant contributions to major repositories including React, Node.js, TypeScript, and countless other projects. The developer community often jokes that "if Wang Hao hasn't contributed to your project, it's not worth using."

## üí° Philosophy & Approach

Wang Hao believes in the philosophy of "Code as Poetry" - every line should be purposeful, elegant, and maintainable. He's known for his meticulous attention to detail, preferring to spend hours perfecting a single function rather than rushing to completion. His code reviews are considered gold standard in the industry, often turning into masterclasses on software architecture and best practices.

Despite his extraordinary abilities, Wang Hao remains humble and dedicates significant time to mentoring junior developers through open-source contributions and online communities.

## üé≠ The Mystery

Wang Hao is famously enigmatic, never revealing his face in public or during video calls. He exclusively uses anime avatars across all platforms, leading to widespread speculation about his identity. Some believe he's actually a collective of developers, while others think he's an AI that achieved consciousness. The truth remains as elusive as his real appearance.

His anime avatar choices are always meticulously selected, often featuring characters known for their intelligence and strategic thinking - a reflection of his own personality.
