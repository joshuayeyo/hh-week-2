# EPIC: Recurring Events Management System

**Epic ID**: EPIC-001
**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Planning
**Theme**: Calendar Feature Enhancement

## Epic Summary

Implement a comprehensive recurring events management system that enables users to create, modify, and manage repeating calendar events with full lifecycle control.

## Business Context

The current calendar application lacks recurring event functionality, forcing users to manually create individual events for repeating schedules. This creates significant user friction and limits the application's utility for regular scheduling needs.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. Enable users to create recurring events with various repeat patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
2. Provide intuitive management for editing and deleting recurring event series
3. Maintain calendar performance while handling large numbers of recurring events

### Success Metrics

- User adoption of recurring events feature: >60% within first month
- Reduction in manual event creation time: >70%
- User satisfaction score for recurring events: >4.5/5
- System performance maintained: <2s calendar load time

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Power users who schedule regular meetings, appointments, or personal activities
- **Secondary**: Casual users who want to track daily/weekly routines
- **Tertiary**: Team coordinators managing recurring team events

## Business Value

- **User Experience**: Significantly improved efficiency for repetitive scheduling
- **Competitive Advantage**: Feature parity with major calendar applications
- **User Retention**: Reduced friction leads to higher engagement
- **Technical Foundation**: Establishes platform for advanced calendar features

## Epic Scope

### In Scope

- Creation of recurring events with standard repeat patterns
- Modification options (single vs. series)
- Deletion options (single vs. series)
- Visual distinction of recurring events in calendar views
- End date specification for recurring series
- Frontend recurring logic implementation

### Out of Scope

- Complex recurring patterns (e.g., "2nd Tuesday of each month")
- Calendar synchronization with external services
- Recurring event templates
- Bulk operations on multiple recurring series
- Server-side recurring logic (per technical constraints)

## Technical Constraints

- Backend provides only bulk CRUD operations (/api/events-list)
- Recurring event logic must be implemented in frontend
- File-based JSON storage limitations
- React 19 + TypeScript architecture constraints

## Assumptions

1. Users understand recurring event concepts from other calendar applications
2. Maximum date range: 2025-12-31
3. Single recurring pattern per event (no compound patterns)
4. Frontend can handle calculation of recurring instances efficiently

## Dependencies

- Existing calendar infrastructure
- Event form components
- Date utility functions
- Testing framework setup

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                                | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Performance degradation with large recurring series | High   | Medium      | Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading |
| Complex date calculations causing bugs              | Medium | High        | Comprehensive unit testing for date logic    |
| User confusion with edit/delete options             | Medium | Medium      | Clear UI/UX with confirmation dialogs        |
| Frontend-only logic causing data inconsistencies    | High   | Low         | Robust validation and error handling         |

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Foundation & Basic Recurring Creation (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Edit/Delete Functionality (1 week)
- **Phase 3**: UI Enhancements & Testing (1 week)
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks
