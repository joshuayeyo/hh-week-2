# PRD: Recurring Events Management System

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27
**Owner**: Product Manager
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive recurring events management system in our calendar application. The feature enables users to create, modify, and delete recurring events with various repeat patterns, significantly improving user productivity and feature completeness.

### Problem Statement

Users currently must manually create individual events for recurring schedules (daily meetings, weekly appointments, monthly reviews), leading to time waste and inconsistent scheduling. This limitation significantly impacts user experience and prevents us from competing with established calendar applications.

### Solution Overview

Implement a full-featured recurring events system with:

- Multiple repeat patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Flexible edit/delete options (single instance vs. entire series)
- Visual distinction in the UI
- Frontend-based recurring logic to work within existing backend constraints

---

## Product Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Improve User Productivity**: Reduce event creation time by 70% for repetitive schedules
2. **Feature Parity**: Match basic recurring functionality of major calendar applications
3. **User Adoption**: Achieve >60% adoption rate within first month of release
4. **Performance**: Maintain calendar load times under 2 seconds

### Success Metrics

- **Engagement**: Increase in average events created per user
- **Retention**: Improved user retention rates
- **Performance**: No degradation in calendar responsiveness
- **Support**: Reduced support tickets for manual event creation

---

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Power Users (40% of user base)**

- Business professionals with regular meetings
- Personal users with consistent schedules
- Team leads managing recurring team events

**Characteristics**:

- Create 10+ events per week
- High engagement with calendar features
- Demand efficiency tools

### Secondary Users

**Casual Users (50% of user base)**

- Occasional calendar users
- Simple recurring needs (workout schedules, medication reminders)
- Basic feature requirements

### Edge Cases

**Heavy Users (10% of user base)**

- Complex scheduling requirements
- Multiple overlapping recurring series
- Performance-sensitive usage patterns

---

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Recurring Event Creation

#### 1.1 Repeat Type Selection

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)

**Requirements**:

- Toggle switch to enable/disable recurring functionality
- Dropdown selection for repeat types:
  - None (default)
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Yearly
- Clear visual indication when recurring is enabled

**Edge Cases**:

- Monthly recurrence on 31st: only create events on months with 31 days
- Yearly recurrence on Feb 29: only create events on leap years
- End date must not exceed 2025-12-31 (system constraint)

#### 1.2 End Date Configuration

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)

**Requirements**:

- Date picker for recurring end date
- Default to 2025-12-31 if not specified
- Validation: end date must be after start date
- Clear indication of total events to be created

### 2. Visual Distinction

#### 2.1 Recurring Event Indicators

**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)

**Requirements**:

- Repeat icon displayed next to recurring event titles
- Icon visible in both calendar and list views
- Consistent iconography across all views
- Optional tooltip showing repeat pattern details

### 3. Event Modification

#### 3.1 Edit Operations

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)

**Single Instance Edit**:

- Confirmation dialog: "해당 일정만 수정하시겠어요?"
- "예" option: Edit only selected instance
- Edited instance becomes non-recurring (loses repeat icon)
- Other series instances remain unchanged

**Series Edit**:

- "아니오" option: Edit all instances in series
- Bulk update of all related events
- Maintain recurring status and icon
- Option to modify repeat pattern for future instances

#### 3.2 Delete Operations

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)

**Single Instance Delete**:

- Confirmation dialog: "해당 일정만 삭제하시겠어요?"
- "예" option: Delete only selected instance
- Series continues with remaining instances

**Series Delete**:

- "아니오" option: Delete entire recurring series
- Remove all instances from calendar
- Complete cleanup of related data

### 4. System Behavior

#### 4.1 Overlap Detection

**Priority**: P1 (Should Have)

**Requirements**:

- Recurring events bypass overlap detection
- No overlap warnings for recurring event creation
- Existing overlap functionality preserved for single events

#### 4.2 Performance Requirements

**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)

**Requirements**:

- Calendar load time: <2 seconds with 1000+ recurring events
- Event creation: <1 second for recurring series up to 365 instances
- Memory usage: No significant increase for normal usage patterns
- Smooth scrolling in calendar views

---

## Technical Constraints

### Backend Limitations

- No server-side recurring logic available
- Bulk operations only via `/api/events-list` endpoints
- File-based JSON storage (not database)
- Frontend must handle all recurring calculations

### Frontend Architecture

- React 19 + TypeScript stack
- Material-UI component library
- Existing state management patterns
- Vitest testing framework

### Data Constraints

- Maximum date range: through 2025-12-31
- Storage in `realEvents.json` or `e2e.json`
- Each recurring instance stored as individual event with shared `repeat.id`

---

## User Experience Requirements

### 1. Usability

- Intuitive repeat type selection
- Clear confirmation dialogs with appropriate Korean text
- Immediate visual feedback for recurring status
- Consistent behavior across calendar and list views

### 2. Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility for repeat indicators
- High contrast support for visual elements
- Focus management in dialogs

### 3. Error Handling

- Clear validation messages for invalid date ranges
- Graceful handling of edge cases (31st, Feb 29)
- Recovery options for failed operations
- Informative error states
